## Informations about updates

- I (IdolKeg) currently have midterm as well as writing a thesis. That's why there are not much update for now. Wait a bit I will update it when I will be done with everything :)
- My motherboard fried today (26/11/2016), and since I don't have 50â‚¬ to spend to replace it (joys of being student), I will have to wait until I find a job after my thesis to afford one.
- So, IF you are a dev and willing to help little bit, feel free :), I like this project as it is free and open source for everyone and useful for some people :)

## Known issues

Work only for Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 for now.


## Current

- Use of ModernUI for WPF Library (Github here: https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui )
- Depending on the video quality (HD / FullHD, 30FPS/60FPS, Codec used) The CPU usage may vary, from almost nothing with a low video quality, 30FPS to high usage with FullHD/4K + 60FPS. Memory usage should be video size + app size
- Load and play most video files like a Live Wallpaper (Looping)
- Can Minimize to Tray
- Multiple Monitor support (Maybe ? need some test, I have only 1, coding blindly)
- Can enable / disable sound while playing and change volume

- WiP different video on each monitor NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED Basically the UI and some controls are here but not working, may crash if you try.

## Upcoming

- Automatic patching ?
- Library management (Maybe ?)
- automatically change wallpapers/videos based on time? Like, one for the morning, one for afternoon, one for night, etc. (From xrailgun )
- 1 different video per monitor (Yes it's possible, it requires some coding but I can do it :b) (It will also increase the CPU and Memory Load.)
- Need to revamp the UI (because this one is quite flawed), using MVVM way
- Make it works as a service startup in Windows.
- Make a config file to load and play the last video on launch (idea: https://www.reddit.com/user/Hi_ItsPaul)
- Lower the CPU usage
- Automatic crash report

## Known issues

- Work on multiple monitors in duplicate mode but not in extended mode
- Doesn't work on Win 7 and lower

## Changelog

	v0.2.5:

	v0.2.4: 
	- Add Gif files should properly loop now
	
	v0.2.3.3:
	- I changed some stuff about the memory management and the objects, even with run stop run stop etc, you should not feel lags.
	- The minimizing to Tray Icon SHOULD work properly and not crash or stay in the Tray even when the application is closed.
	- Minimizing using Minimize button top-right. Closing button will actually close everything properly now. (Unless you want to change it ?)
	- Closing using X button top-right. Closing button will actually close everything properly now. (It was staying in the Task manager actually but now it should work as intended)

Need people that are better than me in C#. This is not coded in MVVM. Also the UI is very ugly. Feel free to fork, pull request :)
